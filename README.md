# I build a Project about Libary Created 3 Table With SqlAlchemy + Flask and return data with json
# To Use this libary you first need to install the requirments + use virtual env.
# Customers,Book,Loan. = SQL Table Names 

# I made Customer Data base , Add a new customer , Remover customer , Display all customers  in the libary  # Search customer by name Done 


# Add a new book , Display all books  , Remove book - Done in 1 page , Find book by name Done. ,return a book update a book 

# Create a loan books , Display all of the loans + Type of the loan 10/5/2 Days , make delete button + Create

# , P.C Also made that if you try to LOAN two same book id you wil get an error, if you duplicate custom id you wil get error , 
# you wil get a message error that says Loan already exists for the given customer and book."

 # display all late loans done combine it with loans and mark it in red
