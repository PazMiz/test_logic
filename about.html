<h1>Welcome to Paz Library Management System!</h1>

<p>Our platform, built using SQLAlchemy, Flask, and JSON, offers a seamless experience for managing books, customers, and loans.</p>

<p>With our platform, you can easily add new books to the library database. Simply provide the book details such as title, author, and availability, and our system will store it securely.</p>

<p>In addition to books, you can also add new customers to our library. Enter their information, including name, contact details, and any other relevant information, and they'll become part of our library community.</p>

<p>Managing loans is a breeze with our system. You can easily track which books are currently on loan, to whom, and when they are due for return. This ensures efficient management of borrowed books and helps avoid any late returns or conflicts.</p>

<p>Our platform also provides a convenient display of all books in the library. You can browse through the entire collection, search for specific titles or authors, and view detailed information about each book, including availability status.</p>

<p>We are committed to providing you with a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience for all your library management needs. Enjoy exploring our library, borrowing books, and being a part of our reading community!</p>
